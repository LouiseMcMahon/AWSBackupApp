# S3 Backup App
An in progress desktop app that will backup and recover files to S3 and Glacier

The goal is to have both a GUI and CLI app that can sync files to and from a versioned S3 bucket, restore from any date and manage lifecycle rules along with create custom ones that can be ran locally or via lambda.

The app is writen in Python 2.7 but a 3.x version is also possible.
